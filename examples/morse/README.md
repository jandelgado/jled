# JLed morse example

This examples demonstrates an efficient method to generate morse code on 
an micro controller like the Arduino.

The morse example uses the morse alphabet encoded in a binary tree to 
generate morse code using a JLed user defined brightness class. The text
to be morsed is transformed into morse code and then transformed into a 
sequence of `1` and `0` which are written out to a GPIO controlling a LED or
a sound generator.
